# Customer Churn Prediction Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers or clients, which can significantly impact a business's revenue and growth. This project aims to predict customer churn using historical data, enabling businesses to identify at-risk customers and implement strategies to retain them.

### Objectives

1. **Understand Customer Behavior**: Analyze customer data to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn.
2. **Predict Churn**: Build a predictive model to forecast which customers are likely to churn.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Provide insights and recommendations to reduce churn rates.

## Data Understanding

### Data Collection

The dataset typically includes various features related to customer demographics, account information, and usage patterns. Common features may include:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Tenure**: Duration of the customer's relationship with the company (in months).
- **Service Usage**: Information on services used (e.g., internet, phone).
- **MonthlyCharges**: Monthly charges incurred by the customer.
- **TotalCharges**: Total charges incurred by the customer.
- **Churn**: Target variable indicating whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).

### Data Exploration

Before building models, it is essential to explore the data to understand its structure, identify missing values, and visualize distributions. This can be done using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Data Preprocessing

### 1. Data Cleaning

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values through imputation or removal.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Ensure that data types are appropriate for analysis (e.g., converting categorical variables to the 'category' type).

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Creating New Features**: Derive new features that may help improve model performance (e.g., creating a feature for high monthly charges).

### 3. Data Splitting

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Visualizations

- **Distribution Plots**: Visualize the distribution of numerical features (e.g., age, tenure) using histograms or box plots.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Analyze correlations between features to identify relationships that may impact churn.
- **Churn Rate Analysis**: Visualize churn rates across different demographics (e.g., gender, age groups) using bar charts.

### 2. Insights

Summarize key findings from the EDA, such as which features are most correlated with churn and any patterns observed in customer behavior.

## Model Building

### 1. Choosing a Model

Select appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification tasks. Common choices for churn prediction include:

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple model for binary classification.
- **Decision Trees**: A model that splits data based on feature values.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Another ensemble method that builds trees sequentially to minimize errors.

### 2. Model Training

Train the selected models using the training dataset. For example, using a Random Forest classifier:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning

Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.

## Model Evaluation

### 1. Performance Metrics

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

### 2. Confusion Matrix

Visualize the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Deployment

### 1. Model Serialization

Save the trained model using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle` for future use.

```python
import joblib

joblib.dump(model, 'churn_model.pkl')
```

### 2. Building a Web Application

Create a user-friendly interface using frameworks like Streamlit or Flask to allow users to input customer data and receive churn predictions.

### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance

Continuously monitor the model's performance in production and update it as necessary to ensure accuracy over time.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to customer churn prediction, from data understanding to model deployment. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and implement strategies to enhance customer retention.
